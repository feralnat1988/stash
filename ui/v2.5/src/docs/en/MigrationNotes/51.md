### Stash is changing the algorithm for how it calculates perceptual hashes for videos shorter than 2.5 minutes

- This migration will move all of your existing phashes for short videos into a deprecated format.
- **You will need to run the generate task** to re-generate all of these short duration phashes with the new algorithm.
  - You do **NOT** need to select the `Overwrite existing files` option, it will automatically see that your short videos are missing a phash and generate them.

In a future version, these obsolete old style phashes will be deleted from your database.
