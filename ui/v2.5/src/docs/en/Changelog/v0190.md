### ðŸ’¥ Known issues
* Performer autotagging does not currently match on performer aliases. This will be addressed when finer control over the matching is implemented.

* Added support for plugins to add injected CSS and Javascript to the UI. ([#3195](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3195))
* Added disambiguation field to Performers, to differentiate between performers with the same name. ([#3113](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3113))

### ðŸŽ¨ Improvements
* Changed performer aliases to be a list, rather than a string field. ([#3113](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/3113))
